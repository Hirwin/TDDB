/*
FIXES -
	Look into a solution to the off timing of spawning a card on a popup box, perhaps using the visual state of the box?


NEW CONTENT --
	Add a direct Damage spell?
	
	Add a 'Defragment' spell that heals your base.
	
	add a fast forward mode
	
	New Permanents - Something to increase action points
	
	Important -- Card IDs is now an ENUM, but keyword needs to be cleaned out of the code still before it can be looked at properly.
	
	look into card ID's and perhaps fixing it so the cardID is an enum with the card names or something, 
	perhaps this can replace keywords since Keywords is kinda in a weird place as being the value needed for some but not others?
	
	Highlight them if they are playable (in the play Space)
	
	IDEA -- information on enemies based on how many killed like Hades -- health resistances, special abilities maybe? add cards to the pool that directly help you when you defeat a certain amount of these enemies?
